## Version 0.0.22 (in development)

* `Typography` component has children instead of `text`.

* Renamed `Dropdown` component into `Select`
  (to refer to MUI component with same name).

* `Select` component has more flexible options.

* Dealing with callbacks parameter and return types 
  that are just `list` and not, e.g., `list[str]`.
