# Contribution API

The Chartlets contribution API is used by both application providers 
and contributors:

- Application providers implement specific contributions for their application
  using `Contribution` as a base class.
- Application contributors use the instantiate and parameterize the specific 
  contributions and implement the functions to create the contributions'
  user interface (layout) and their event handlers (callbacks).
