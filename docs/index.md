# Welcome to Chartlets

Chartlets is a software framework that allows websites developed with
React to be extended by server-side widgets programmed in Python or other
programming languages. 

It comprises a 
[Python backend package](https://github.com/bcdev/chartlets/tree/main/chartlets.py)
and a 
[JavaScript/React frontend package](https://github.com/bcdev/chartlets/tree/main/chartlets.js).

## Features

- Enhance your React web application by UI-contributions programmed in Python
- Enhance your (Python) web API to serve server-side UI-contributions.
- Uses [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) components and 
  [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) charts.
